Hi. This is one of my first projects looking into machine learning and artificial intelligence. 
Whilst vastly abstracted from common machine learning algorithms it seemed like a nice way to get into it.

It's probably better if you see it for yourself.

I have also looked into backpropagation and have been able to create a simple example of a machine learning how to recognise and recite the inputs/outputs of
a xor gate. Another simple task but yet again it's only a proof of concept. 
Looking into convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks is my next focus once school is over and time provides.
